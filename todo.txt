What do these things do/ are they still implemented:

dump_valve
recycle_valve
hot_water_valve

Any other functions for override?

Does the steam tank fill before main tank? 
if main tank is empty can the steam tank always be full?
(Do we have to wait for the main tank to fill before the steam heater can be turned on?)
