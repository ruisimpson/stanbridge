Stanbridge CS1 CS2 code prototyping

This is a program to control our electronic system that drives the Stanbridge Limited CS1 and CS2 bedpan washing machines.

The program has many capabilities:
- Running and performing all the current functions the machines have been able to historically perofrm
- Added fault finding to look for problems with the function of the machine, ie: pump failure, heating element failure, door failure, and more
- Added LCD display for showing wash cycle progress
- Added Wireless communication to send errors back to the factory, so service engineers have more information
